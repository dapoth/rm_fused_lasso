:file:`research_paper.tex` contains the actual paper. The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we introduce lasso, define its optimization problem and investigate some interesting properties. In section 3 we present the fused lasso as an extension of the lasso, describe its behavior and properties. We provide some insights on the solution method. This is followed by a sketch of the fused lasso signal approximator, which is later used for our real data application. Asymptotic results for both lasso and fused lasso are outlined in section 4. We propose a python implementation of the fused lasso estimator in section 5. In section 6 we present a simulation study comparing the performance of the fused lasso with the lasso and another penalized regressions. An application of the fused lasso to genomic data is discussed in section 7.
