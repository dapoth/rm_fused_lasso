The directory *src.model_specs* contains `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ files with model specifications. There are four files for the four different settings described in :ref:`data_management`.
 
Each JSON file contains the following model parameters for the simulations:
 
 * Number of observations
 * Number of regressors
 * Number of blocks, their lengths and their values
 * Number of spikes
 * Number of simulations
 * Minimum and maximum value for the s1 and s2 grid and the grid density (for cross-validation)
