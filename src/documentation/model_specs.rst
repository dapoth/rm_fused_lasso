Model specifications
********************

The directory *src.model_specs* contains `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ files with model specifications. The choice of JSON is motivated by the attempt to be language-agnostic: JSON is quite expressive and there are parsers for nearly all languages.
 
 
The JSON files contain the following model parameters for the simulations:
 
 * Number of observations
 * Number of regressors
 * Number of blocks, their lengths and their values
 * Number of spikes
 * Number of simulations
 * Minimum and maximum value for the s1 and s2 grid
